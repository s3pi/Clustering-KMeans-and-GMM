Non linear Separable dataâ€™s accuracy is higher when we considered that the data from a single
class is coming from several Gaussian Mixture models.
Real World data also shows similar behaviour.
The decision boundary obtained in Non Linear and Real world data is very sophisticated hyper
plane compared to the decision boundary obtained with Bayesian Classifier.
Scene Image data, since we considered non overlapping 32*32 patches, the accuracy generally
low.
Cell Image data, since we considered overlapping patches, although we ran GMM with reduced
set of training data points, segmentation appears close to the original image.
